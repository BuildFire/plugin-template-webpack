## Getting Started
Be sure to have the latest [BuildFire CLI](https://github.com/BuildFire/sdk-cli) installed in your system.

    # Download the latest SDK if you haven't already
    $ buildfire init

    # Once inside the SDK's folder
    $ buildfire plugin init <pluginName> webpack

## Usage
Be sure to be in the plugin's folder while running the following commands:

* `$ npm install` - Install all plugin dependencies
* `$ npm start` - Runs the plugin in the [Plugin Tester](https://github.com/BuildFire/sdk/wiki/How-to-test-your-Plugin-locally)
* `$ npm run-script build` - Builds the plugin to be [submitted to the Marketplace](https://github.com/BuildFire/sdk/wiki/How-to-submit-your-plugin)
